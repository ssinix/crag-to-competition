    "# **8a.nu Sport Climbing Scraper**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook scrapes sport climbing data from climber profiles on [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/), a popular platform for tracking climbing ascents. Using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**, it extracts key performance metrics for each climber, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Highest Grade Climbed**: The most difficult route completed.\n",
    "- **8c+ and Above Ascent Count**: The total number of ascents at grade 8c+ or higher.\n",
    "- **Average Grade**: Weighted average of the first 5 unique grades (converted via `grade_to_linear_scale`), using ascent counts. The top 5 grades are used instead of all grades to avoid skewing the average downward for climbers who have many lower-grade ascents alongside significant high-grade achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sourced from individual climber profile pages (e.g., sport climbing sections) identified in a prior notebook (`1.2_8anu_profile_finder`).\n",
    "\n",
    "8a.nu uses the French Grading System, for more context on sport climbing grades, you can refer to [this website](https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/rock-climbing-grades/).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges Encountered**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several obstacles were navigated during the development of this scraper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grade Conversion Complexity**: Converting climbing grades (e.g., 8a+, 9b) into numerical values for averaging required custom logic. A linear scale was implemented (e.g., 7a = 1, 7a+ = 2) to handle this, with weights applied based on ascent counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Locating Statistics Data**: Extracting data from the profile pages demanded precise parsing of the `statistics-body` HTML block. Early attempts struggled with inconsistent page structures, necessitating a refined approach using BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropdown Navigation Issues**: Profile pages default to a “Last 12 Months” view in a dropdown menu, but “All Time” data was needed. Automating the switch to “All Time” using Selenium proved challenging and remains buggy—it often requires the WebDriver UI to be visible and fails in headless mode.\n",
