    "# **8a.nu Climber Profile Scraper**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook identifies and saves [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/) profiles of IFSC competition climbers, whose data was scraped in the previous notebook (**1.1_ifsc_scraper**). Using Selenium for web automation, it searches for climbers names directly via 8a.nu’s user search URL and extracts the most relevant profile based on name similarity. To improve accuracy, it employs **fuzzy string matching** (`fuzzywuzzy`) to account for variations in names and common nicknames.\n",
    "\n",
    " To ensure meaningful results, only profiles with recorded ascents are considered. The final data, including climber names and the highest-probability profile links, is saved to a CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges Encountered**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct URL-Based Search Instead of Input-Based Search:**\n",
    "   - Instead of relying on the website's search bar, the script queries the 8a.nu user search page directly, reducing the risk of automation blocks and ensuring faster navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Exact Name Matching:**\n",
    "   - Climbers' usernames on 8a.nu often differ from their official competition names, requiring a more flexible matching approach.\n",
    "   - To handle variations, the script uses **fuzzy string matching (`fuzzywuzzy`)** with a **90% similarity threshold**, selecting only the most probable match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nicknames Used as Usernames:**\n",
    "   - Some climbers use nicknames instead of their full names (e.g., *Alexander Megos* vs. *Alex Megos*).\n",
    "   - To improve accuracy, the script includes a **nickname lookup table** that accounts for common name variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Profiles Without Ascent Data:**\n",
    "   - Some climbers have 8a.nu accounts but no recorded ascents, making their profiles irrelevant for performance analysis.\n",
    "   - The script **automatically discards profiles with zero ascents**, ensuring that only active climbers are considered.\n",
