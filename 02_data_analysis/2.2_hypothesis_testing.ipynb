    "# Hypothesis Testing on IFSC and 8a.nu Climbing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This  explores statistical relationships between outdoor and competition climbing performance using a dataset derived from two key sources: **IFSC** (competition climbing data) and **8a.nu** (outdoor climbing data), which was scraped and merged in the notebooks located in the `01_data_collection` folder. For details on the data collection and merging process, refer to those notebooks. By analyzing this unified dataset, we aim to investigate whether measurable trends or correlations exist between climbers’ achievements across different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of this analysis are to test the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outdoor vs. Competition Performance**\n",
    "   Do climbers with stronger outdoor climbing metrics—such as higher maximum grade or having a 8c+ ascent—also perform better in competitions?\n",
    "   *Separate hypothesis tests will be conducted for each competition discipline: bouldering, lead, and combined.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary Competition Correlation**\n",
    "   Is there a statistically significant correlation between performance in different IFSC competition disciplines (e.g., do high lead scores correlate with high boulder scores)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outdoor Performance Correlation**\n",
    "   Within outdoor climbing, is there a meaningful correlation between the metrics (e.g., do higher average grades correlate with higher best grade climbed)?\n"
